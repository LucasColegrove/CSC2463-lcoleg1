        <hr>
        
        <h2>Project Outline</h2>
        <p>Super Luigi Pong is a pong like game using P5.js for graphics, Tone.js for sound, and an arduino for controller support. The player is greeted with a start menu which gives a synopsis of the game.
            Upon clicking, a gameplay screen is started. In order to win you must not make any mistakes in a pong match for 30 seconds. If this is achieved a victory screen pops up. The pong padel
             is controlled using a potentiometer wired to an arduino. All graphical elements such as the gameplay components were made in P5.js. Tone.js was used to create the background melody.

        <h2>Narrative Description</h2>
        <p>
            Luigi must save the Mushroom Kingdom using the power of pong! Deflect the projectile long enough to win!

       <h2>Future Development</h2>
       <p>In the future Super Luigi Pong will be taken to new heights! The logic to determine if the player missed the ball will be improved and more features will be added. A score showing
          how many times the player has hit the ball will be implemented and LED lights on the arduino will light up if the player misses the ball or hits the ball (red for miss green for hit).
          Also, a game over screen will be created.
